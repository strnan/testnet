# Backup Node

This is very important to have backup node if you have some problem with your Main Node like missing chunks and low performance. I try to migrate my own nodes from Contabo to Hetzner. Because i use Contabo have many issue with producing chunks (many missed chunks) and now after moving to Hetzner no longer missing alot of chunks.

Before we start, make sure you already installed all packages required to running NEAR-CLI (It's like you installing from old node). You can follow my own guide from 001 to 004 [here](https://github.com/yantodotid/testnet/tree/main/stakewars).

### Save important files

Make sure before running your node, first thing you need to do is save your `node_key.json` and `validator_key.json`. You can use `cat` to show inside this file or using SFTP and download this file in `.near` folder.

### Change Files Name and Check `public_key`

This is to make sure your old node (main node) it's not same as your new node (backup node). Because if you're running node in the same time, you'll get slashed.

After that you'll need to use different key to make sure your old node and new node completely different. The reason is same as above (get slashed).

But if you want to use same `public_key` from old node, you just need to change file name and stop your service.

### Update IP in `config.json`

Update your IP and public_key (from `node_key.json`) in `config.json` because you already migrate from old node to new node.

### :warning:(WARNING) Before we start the service, make sure your old node is stopped and only run with your new node.

You can follow this step to stop your old node and start your new node service.

- For your old node :

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop neard
  ```

- For your new node :

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable neard
  sudo systemctl start neard
  ```

Now it's done, you already migrating from old node to new node.
